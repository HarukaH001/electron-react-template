## Electron React Js Template
Electronjs cross-platform desktop application template using Reactjs as base.<br/>
I built this template so that I don't get troubled setting this up everytime I got works that needed this.<br/>
This is not only cross-platform for **desktop** but also **web** deployable at the same time. Good for me :D
### Available Scripts
In the project directory, you mostly using these:
### `npm start`
Runs the **web application** in development mode.<br/>
Running on http://localhost:3000
### `npm run build`
Build the **web application** for production to the `build` folder.
### `npm run electron-dev`
Runs both the web application and desktop application in development mode with hot reload feature.<br/>
**This is important since desktop application in development mode needs web application running.**
### `npm run electron-pack`
Build the **desktop application** for distribution or whatever.
**Setting for Windows 32bit and 64bit. Configuration in package.json needed for other platform**
